Introduction
============

SolarTherm aims to provide an easy way to simulate and optimise concentrating solar thermal power (CSP) systems. The project is focussed on the research community, who want to be able to quickly assess novel combinations of different receivers, storage, fluids, control strategies and power cycles.  The simulation is at a level of detail required to accurately assess whole system performance and economic viability.

Currently the project contains a Modelica model library and a loose collection of tools that make it easy to run thermal and economic performance analysis over a year-long simulation.  These tools will become more integrated and provide further features such as design and control optimisation as the project develops.
