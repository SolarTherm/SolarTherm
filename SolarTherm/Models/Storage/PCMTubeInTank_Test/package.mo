  		<p>1D numerical modelling of the heat transfer between phase change material (PCM) and heat transfer fluid (HTF) in a shell-and-tube configuration. The PCM and HTF is located in the shell and tube side, respectively, with heat conduction through the tube wall in between them. Temperature variations in the flow direction are considered in domains of PCM, HTF and tube wall. </p>
