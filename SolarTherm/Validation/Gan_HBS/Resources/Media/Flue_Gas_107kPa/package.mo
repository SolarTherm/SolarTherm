  /* The vector substanceNames is mandatory, as the number of
  		substances is determined based on its size. Here we assume
  		a single-component medium.
  		singleState is true if u and d do not depend on pressure, but only
  		on a thermal variable (temperature or enthalpy). Otherwise, set it
  		to false.
  		For a single-substance medium, just set reducedX and fixedX to true, and there's
  		no need to bother about medium compositions at all. Otherwise, set
  		final reducedX = true if the medium model has nS-1 independent mass
  		fraction, or reducedX = false if the medium model has nS independent
  		mass fractions (nS = number of substances).
  		If a mixture has a fixed composition set fixedX=true, otherwise false.
  		The modifiers for reducedX and fixedX should normally be final
  		since the other equations are based on these values.

  		It is also possible to redeclare the min, max, and start attributes of
  		Medium types, defined in the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium
  		(the example of Temperature is shown here). Min and max attributes
  		should be set in accordance to the limits of validity of the medium
  		model, while the start attribute should be a reasonable default value
  		for the initialization of nonlinear solver iterations */

  		than one substance. Provide 3 equations to obtain the remaining
  		variables as functions of the independent variables.
  		It is also necessary to provide two additional equations to set
  		the gas constant R and the molar mass MM of the medium.
  		Finally, the thermodynamic state vector, defined in the base class
  		Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties, should be set, according to
  		its definition (see ThermodynamicState below).
  		The computation of vector X[nX] from Xi[nXi] is already included in
  		the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties, so it should not
  		be repeated here.
  		The code fragment below is for a single-substance medium with
  		p,T as independent variables.
