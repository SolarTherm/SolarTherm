    		on a thermal variable (temperature or enthalpy). Otherwise, set it
    		to false.
    		For a single-substance medium, just set reducedX and fixedX to true, and there's
    		no need to bother about medium compositions at all. Otherwise, set
    		final reducedX = true if the medium model has nS-1 independent mass
    		fraction, or reducedX = false if the medium model has nS independent
    		mass fractions (nS = number of substances).
    		If a mixture has a fixed composition set fixedX=true, otherwise false.
    		The modifiers for reducedX and fixedX should normally be final
    		since the other equations are based on these values.

    		It is also possible to redeclare the min, max, and start attributes of
    		Medium types, defined in the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium
    		(the example of Temperature is shown here). Min and max attributes
    		should be set in accordance to the limits of validity of the medium
    		model, while the start attribute should be a reasonable default value

    		It is also necessary to provide two additional equations to set
    		the gas constant R and the molar mass MM of the medium.
    		Finally, the thermodynamic state vector, defined in the base class
    		Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties, should be set, according to
    		its definition (see ThermodynamicState below).
    		The computation of vector X[nX] from Xi[nXi] is already included in
