	// h is obtained by integrating (cp dT). The integration constant was added such that the h value at T = 298.15K (i.e. 25 degC) becomes zero.
	// Philipe Gunawan : I plot it in excel I got the same result of h as a function of T using 2nd degree polynomial 0.221 * T^2 + 805.36*T-265785 with deviation value of R = 1
