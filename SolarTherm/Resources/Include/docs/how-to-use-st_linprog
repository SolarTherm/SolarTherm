Since st_linprog.c use GLPK which is an external library, it has dependency on it:

Step by step :

1. Got to ~/SolarTherm/Resources/Include/
2. Convert st_linprog.c into a dynamic library namely liblinprog.so using this command
			gcc -fPIC -shared -lglpk -o liblinprog.so st_linprog.c && cp liblinprog.so ./lib/ && rm -rf liblinprog.so
3. Since liblinprog.so is depending on glpk.h then we have to copy liblinprog.so 
			cp /usr/local/lib/libglpk.so ~/solartherm-particle/SolarTherm/Resources/Include/lib/
		* the directory where glpk.h is located may differ
		* if using standard installation, then glpk.h will be located in /usr/local/
4. External function Modelica (LinProgFunc.mo):
		-at annotation part, use:
			annotation(Library ={"linprog","glpk"},
            LibraryDirectory="modelica://SolarTherm/Resources/Include/lib");
