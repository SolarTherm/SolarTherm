Since st_linprog.c use GLPK which is an external library, it has dependency on it:

Step by step :

1. Got to ~/SolarTherm/Resources/Include/
2. Convert st_linprog.c into a dynamic library namely liblinprog.so using this command
			gcc -fPIC -shared -ltensorflow -o libsurrogate.so st_surrogate.c && cp libsurrogate.so ./lib/ && rm -rf libsurrogate.so
3. Since libsurrogate.so is depending on tensorflow.h then we have to copy tensorflow.h 
			cp /usr/local/lib/libtensorflow.so ~/solartherm-particle/SolarTherm/Resources/Include/lib/ 
		* the directory where glpk.h is located may differ
		* if using standard installation, then libtensorflow.so will be located in /usr/local/lib
4. External function Modelica (LinProgFunc.mo):
		-at annotation part, use:
    	(Library ={"surrogate","tensorflow"},
     	LibraryDirectory="modelica://SolarTherm/Resources/Include/lib");
